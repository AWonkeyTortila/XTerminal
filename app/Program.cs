/* 
    I just came up with the idea of making this into a dating sim.
    First in a console app in C#, than we gatter a large following, then we
    make a game that they will buy for 60$, and that there is ton of DLC for
    and and and...

    I'm only joking, the game would OBV be free, and so would the DLC.
